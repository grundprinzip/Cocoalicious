# What is Cocoalicious? 

Cocoalicious is a del.icio.us client for Mac OS X. It
acts as a desktop interface to your del.icio.us bookmarks

Cocoalicious is open source, available under the terms of the BSD License. If
happen to have an iPod (and who doesn't these days?) and you'd like to support
Cocoalicious development, you might consider purchasing an $8 license for
PodWorks, my iPod song transfer application.
